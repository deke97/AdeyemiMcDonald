 * Description of Project: Write a detailed description of your project,
 * describing how you *actually* implemented it.  Be sure to cover:
 * - overview (provide a high level overview of your project and its functionality)
 * - object-oriented design (how did you incorporate techniques we discussed in class 
          on proper object-oriented design, including class decomposition, how classes
          interacted, etc?)
 * - techniques (describe any algorithms/techniques you used in your project)
 * - efficiency (how is your implementation computationally efficient?)
 * - expandability (how does your design/implementation allow the program to be 
                    easily extended with new functionality in the future?)
 * - challenges (what parts of your project were especially challenging?)
 * - open problems (are there any open issues with your project?)
 * The overall length of this description should be approximately 1 page
 * of single-spaced text.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Instructions for Running Your Project: 
 *  Provide DETAILED step-by-step instructions for running your project 
 *  and any notes on what the TAs should pay particular attention to when 
 *  grading.  If they can't run your project or didn't notice a particularly 
 *  cool aspect of it because you didn't provide thorough enough instructions, 
 *  then you won't receive credit for it.  It is your responsibility to make 
 *  sure these instructions are thorough and correct.
